Races
Racial Traits
The	description	of	each	race	includes	racial	traits
that	are	common	to	members	of	that	race.	The
following	entries	appear	among	the	traits	of	most
races.
Ability Score Increase
Every	race	increases	one	or	more	of	a	character’s
ability	scores.
Age
The	age	entry	notes	the	age	when	a	member	of the
race	is	considered	an	adult,	as	well	as	the	race’s
expected	lifespan.	This	information	can	help	you
decide	how	old	your	character	is	at	the	start	of	the
game.	You	can	choose	any	age	for	your	character,
which	could	provide	an	explanation	for	some	of	your
ability	scores.	For	example,	if	you	play	a	young	or
very	old	character,	your	age	could	explain	a
particularly	low	Strength	or	Constitution	score,
while	advanced	age	could	account	for	a	high
Intelligence	or	Wisdom.
Alignment
Most	races	have	tendencies	toward	certain
alignments,	described	in	this	entry.	These	are	not
binding	for	player	characters,	but	considering	why
your	dwarf	is	chaotic,	for	example,	in	defiance	of
lawful	dwarf	society	can	help	you	better	define	your
character.
Size
Characters	of	most	races	are	Medium,	a	size	category
including	creatures	that	are	roughly	4	to	8	feet	tall.
Members	of	a	few	races	are	Small	(between	2	and	4
feet	tall),	which	means	that	certain	rules	of	the	game
affect	them	differently.	The	most	important	of	these
rules	is	that	Small	characters	have	trouble	wielding
heavy	weapons,	as	explained	in	“Equipment.”
Speed
Your	speed	determines	how	far	you	can	move	when
traveling	(	“Adventuring”)	and	fighting	(“Combat”).
Languages
By	virtue	of	your	race,	your	character	can	speak,
read,	and	write	certain	languages.
Subraces
Some	races	have	subraces.	Members	of	a	subrace
have	the	traits	of	the	parent	race	in	addition	to	the
traits	specified	for	their	subrace.	Relationships
among	subraces	vary	significantly	from	race	to	race
and	world	to	world.
Dwarf
Dwarf Traits
Your	dwarf	character	has	an	assortment	of	inborn
abilities,	part	and	parcel	of	dwarven	nature.
Ability	Score	Increase. Your	Constitution	score
increases	by	2.
Age.	Dwarves	mature	at	the	same	rate	as	humans,
but	they’re	considered	young	until	they	reach	the
age	of	50.	On	average,	they	live	about	350	years.
Alignment.	Most	dwarves	are	lawful,	believing
firmly	in	the	benefits	of	a	well-ordered	society.	They
tend	toward	good	as	well,	with	a	strong	sense	of	fair
play	and	a	belief	that	everyone	deserves	to	share	in
the	benefits	of	a	just	order.
Size. Dwarves	stand	between	4	and	5	feet	tall	and
average	about	150	pounds.	Your	size	is	Medium.
Speed. Your	base	walking	speed	is	25	feet.	Your
speed	is	not	reduced	by	wearing	heavy	armor.
Darkvision. Accustomed	to	life	underground,	you
have	superior	vision	in	dark	and	dim	conditions.	You
can	see	in	dim	light	within	60	feet	of	you	as	if	it	were
bright	light,	and	in	darkness	as	if	it	were	dim	light.
You	can’t	discern	color	in	darkness,	only	shades	of
gray.
Dwarven	Resilience.	You	have	advantage	on
saving	throws	against	poison,	and	you	have
resistance	against	poison	damage.
Dwarven	Combat	Training. You	have	proficiency
with	the	battleaxe,	handaxe,	light	hammer,	and
warhammer.
Tool	Proficiency. You	gain	proficiency	with	the
artisan’s	tools	of	your	choice:	smith’s	tools,	brewer’s
supplies,	or	mason’s	tools.
Stonecunning.	Whenever	you	make	an
Intelligence	(History)	check	related	to	the	origin	of
stonework,	you	are	considered	proficient	in	the
History	skill	and	add	double	your	proficiency	bonus
to	the	check,	instead	of	your	normal	proficiency
bonus.
Languages. You	can	speak,	read,	and	write
Common	and	Dwarvish.	Dwarvish	is	full	of	hard
consonants	and	guttural	sounds,	and	those
characteristics	spill	over	into	whatever	other
language	a	dwarf	might	speak.
Not	for	resale.	Permission	granted	to	print	or	photocopy	this	document	for	personal	use	only. System	Reference	Document	5.1 4
Hill Dwarf
As	a	hill	dwarf,	you	have	keen	senses,	deep	intuition,
and	remarkable	resilience.
Ability	Score	Increase.	Your	Wisdom	score
increases	by	1.
Dwarven	Toughness. Your	hit	point	maximum
increases	by	1,	and	it	increases	by	1	every	time	you
gain	a	level.
Elf
Elf Traits
Your	elf	character	has	a	variety	of	natural	abilities,
the	result	of	thousands	of	years	of	elven	refinement.
Ability	Score	Increase.	Your	Dexterity	score
increases	by 2.
Age. Although	elves	reach	physical	maturity	at
about	the	same	age	as	humans,	the	elven
understanding	of	adulthood	goes	beyond	physical
growth	to	encompass	worldly	experience.	An	elf
typically	claims	adulthood	and	an	adult	name
around	the	age	of	100	and	can	live	to	be	750	years
old.
Alignment. Elves	love	freedom,	variety,	and	selfexpression,	so	they	lean	strongly	toward	the	gentler
aspects	of	chaos.	They	value	and	protect	others’
freedom	as	well	as	their	own,	and	they	are	more
often	good	than	not.
Size. Elves	range	from	under	5	to	over	6	feet	tall
and	have	slender	builds.	Your	size	is	Medium.
Speed. Your	base	walking	speed	is	30	feet.
Darkvision. Accustomed	to	twilit	forests	and	the
night	sky,	you	have	superior	vision	in	dark	and	dim
conditions.	You can	see	in	dim	light	within	60	feet	of
you	as	if	it	were	bright	light,	and	in	darkness	as	if	it
were	dim	light.	You	can’t	discern	color	in	darkness,
only	shades	of	gray.
Keen	Senses.	You	have	proficiency	in	the
Perception	skill.
Fey	Ancestry. You	have	advantage	on	saving
throws	against	being	charmed,	and	magic	can’t	put
you	to	sleep.
Trance. Elves	don’t	need	to	sleep.	Instead,	they
meditate	deeply,	remaining	semiconscious,	for	4
hours	a	day.	(The	Common	word	for	such	meditation
is	“trance.”)	While	meditating,	you	can	dream	after	a
fashion;	such	dreams	are	actually	mental	exercises
that	have	become	reflexive	through	years	of	practice.
After	resting	in	this	way,	you	gain	the	same	benefit
that	a	human	does	from	8	hours	of	sleep.
Languages. You	can	speak,	read,	and	write
Common	and	Elvish.	Elvish	is	fluid,	with	subtle
intonations	and	intricate	grammar.	Elven	literature
is	rich	and	varied,	and	their	songs	and	poems	are
famous	among	other	races.	Many	bards	learn	their
language	so	they	can	add	Elvish	ballads	to their
repertoires.
High Elf
As	a	high	elf,	you	have	a	keen	mind	and	a	mastery	of
at	least	the	basics	of	magic.	In	many	fantasy	gaming
worlds,	there	are	two	kinds	of	high	elves.	One	type	is
haughty	and	reclusive,	believing	themselves	to	be
superior	to	non-elves	and	even	other	elves.	The
other	type	is	more	common	and	more	friendly,	and
often	encountered	among	humans	and	other	races.
Ability	Score	Increase. Your	Intelligence	score
increases	by	1.
Elf	Weapon	Training.	You	have	proficiency	with
the	longsword, shortsword,	shortbow,	and	longbow.
Cantrip. You	know	one	cantrip	of	your	choice
from	the	wizard	spell	list.	Intelligence	is	your
spellcasting	ability	for	it.
Extra	Language.	You	can	speak,	read,	and	write
one	extra	language	of	your	choice.
Halfling
Halfling Traits
Your	halfling	character	has	a	number	of	traits	in
common	with	all	other	halflings.
Ability	Score	Increase. Your	Dexterity	score
increases	by	2.
Age.	A	halfling	reaches	adulthood	at	the	age	of	20
and	generally	lives	into	the	middle	of	his	or	her
second	century.
Alignment. Most	halflings	are	lawful	good.	As	a
rule,	they	are	good-hearted	and	kind,	hate	to	see
others	in	pain,	and	have	no	tolerance	for	oppression.
They	are	also	very	orderly	and	traditional,	leaning
heavily	on	the	support	of	their community	and	the
comfort	of	their	old	ways.
Size. Halflings	average	about	3	feet	tall	and	weigh
about	40	pounds.	Your	size	is	Small.
Speed. Your	base	walking	speed	is	25	feet.
Lucky. When	you	roll	a	1	on	the	d20	for	an	attack
roll,	ability	check,	or	saving	throw,	you	can	reroll	the
die	and	must	use	the	new	roll.
Brave. You	have	advantage	on	saving	throws
against	being	frightened.
Not	for	resale.	Permission	granted	to	print	or	photocopy	this	document	for	personal	use	only. System	Reference	Document	5.1 5
Halfling	Nimbleness.	You	can	move	through	the
space	of	any	creature	that	is	of	a	size	larger	than
yours.
Languages. You	can	speak,	read,	and	write
Common	and	Halfling.	The	Halfling	language	isn’t
secret,	but	halflings	are	loath	to	share	it	with	others.
They	write	very	little,	so	they	don’t	have	a	rich	body
of	literature.	Their	oral	tradition,	however,	is	very
strong.	Almost	all	halflings	speak	Common	to
converse	with	the	people	in	whose	lands	they	dwell
or	through	which	they	are	traveling.
Lightfoot
As	a	lightfoot	halfling,	you	can	easily	hide	from
notice,	even	using	other	people	as	cover.	You’re
inclined	to	be	affable	and	get	along	well	with	others.
Lightfoots	are	more	prone	to	wanderlust	than
other	halflings,	and	often	dwell	alongside	other	races
or	take	up	a	nomadic	life.
Ability	Score	Increase. Your	Charisma	score
increases	by	1.
Naturally	Stealthy. You	can	attempt	to	hide	even
when	you	are	obscured	only	by	a	creature	that	is	at
least	one	size	larger	than	you.
Human
Human Traits
It’s	hard	to	make	generalizations	about	humans,	but
your	human	character	has	these	traits.
Ability	Score	Increase.	Your	ability	scores	each
increase	by	1.
Age. Humans	reach	adulthood	in	their	late	teens
and	live	less	than	a	century.
Alignment. Humans	tend	toward	no	particular
alignment.	The	best	and	the	worst	are	found	among
them.
Size. Humans	vary	widely	in	height	and	build,
from	barely	5	feet	to	well	over	6	feet	tall.	Regardless
of	your	position	in	that	range,	your	size	is	Medium.
Speed. Your	base	walking	speed	is	30	feet.
Languages. You	can	speak,	read,	and	write
Common	and	one	extra	language	of	your	choice.
Humans	typically	learn	the	languages	of	other
peoples	they	deal	with,	including	obscure	dialects.
They	are	fond	of	sprinkling	their	speech	with	words
borrowed	from	other	tongues:	Orc	curses,	Elvish
musical	expressions,	Dwarvish	military	phrases,	and
so	on.
Dragonborn
Dragonborn Traits
Your	draconic	heritage	manifests	in	a	variety	of
traits	you	share	with	other	dragonborn.
Ability	Score	Increase. Your	Strength	score
increases	by	2,	and	your	Charisma	score	increases
by 1.
Age.	Young	dragonborn	grow	quickly.	They	walk
hours	after	hatching,	attain	the	size	and
development	of	a	10-year-old	human	child	by	the
age	of	3,	and	reach	adulthood	by	15.	They	live	to	be
around	80.
Alignment. Dragonborn	tend	to	extremes,	making
a	conscious	choice	for	one	side	or	the	other	in	the
cosmic	war	between	good	and	evil.	Most	dragonborn
are	good,	but	those	who	side	with	evil	can	be	terrible
villains.
Size. Dragonborn	are	taller	and	heavier	than
humans,	standing	well	over	6	feet	tall	and	averaging
almost	250	pounds.	Your	size	is	Medium.
Speed. Your	base	walking	speed	is	30	feet.

Draconic	Ancestry. You	have	draconic	ancestry.
Choose	one	type	of	dragon	from	the	Draconic
Ancestry	table.	Your	breath	weapon	and	damage
resistance	are	determined	by	the	dragon	type,	as
shown	in	the	table.
Breath	Weapon. You	can	use	your	action	to
exhale	destructive	energy.	Your	draconic	ancestry
determines	the	size,	shape,	and	damage	type	of	the
exhalation.
When	you	use	your	breath	weapon,	each	creature
in	the	area	of	the	exhalation	must	make	a	saving
throw,	the	type	of	which	is	determined	by	your
draconic	ancestry.	The	DC	for	this	saving	throw
equals	8	+	your	Constitution	modifier	+	your

Damage	Resistance.	You	have	resistance	to	the
damage	type	associated	with	your	draconic	ancestry.

Common	and	Draconic.	Draconic	is	thought	to	be	one
of	the	oldest	languages	and	is	often	used	in	the	study
of	magic.	The	language	sounds	harsh	to	most	other
creatures	and	includes	numerous	hard	consonants
and	sibilants.
Gnome
Gnome Traits

common	with	all	other	gnomes.
Ability	Score	Increase. Your	Intelligence	score
increases	by	2.
Age. Gnomes	mature	at	the	same	rate	humans	do,

life	by	around	age	40.	They	can	live	350	to	almost
500	years.
Alignment. Gnomes	are	most	often	good.	Those
who	tend	toward	law	are	sages,	engineers,
researchers, scholars,	investigators,	or	inventors.
Those	who	tend	toward	chaos	are	minstrels,
tricksters,	wanderers,	or	fanciful	jewelers.	Gnomes
are	good-hearted,	and	even	the	tricksters	among
them	are	more	playful	than	vicious.
Size. Gnomes	are	between	3	and	4	feet	tall	and
average	about	40	pounds.	Your	size	is	Small.

have	superior	vision	in	dark	and	dim	conditions.	You

bright	light,	and	in	darkness	as	if	it	were	dim	light.
You	can’t	discern	color	in	darkness,	only	shades	of
gray.
Gnome	Cunning. You	have	advantage	on	all
Intelligence,	Wisdom,	and	Charisma	saving	throws
against	magic.

about	the	natural	world.

add	twice	your	proficiency	bonus,	instead	of	any
proficiency	bonus	you	normally	apply.
Tinker. You	have	proficiency	with	artisan’s	tools
(tinker’s	tools).	Using	those	tools,	you	can	spend	1
hour	and	10	gp	worth	of	materials	to	construct	a
Tiny	clockwork	device	(AC	5,	1	hp).	The	device
ceases	to	function	after	24	hours	(unless	you	spend
1	hour	repairing	it	to	keep	the	device	functioning),
or	when	you	use	your	action	to	dismantle	it;	at	that
time,	you	can	reclaim	the	materials	used	to	create	it.
You	can	have	up	to	three	such	devices	active	at	a
time.
When	you	create	a	device,	choose	one	of	the
following	options:
Clockwork	Toy.	This	toy	is	a	clockwork	animal,
monster,	or	person,	such	as	a	frog,	mouse,	bird,
dragon,	or	soldier.	When	placed	on	the	ground,	the
toy	moves	5	feet	across	the	ground	on	each	of	your
turns	in	a	random	direction.	It	makes	noises	as
appropriate	to	the	creature	it	represents.
Fire	Starter.	The	device	produces	a	miniature	flame,
which	you	can	use	to	light	a	candle,	torch,	or
campfire.	Using	the	device	requires	your	action.
Music	Box.	When	opened,	this	music	box	plays	a
single	song	at	a	moderate	volume.	The	box	stops
playing	when	it	reaches	the	song’s	end	or	when	it
is	closed.

Alignment.	Half-elves	share	the	chaotic	bent	of
their	elven	heritage.	They	value	both	personal
freedom	and	creative	expression,	demonstrating
neither	love	of	leaders	nor	desire	for	followers.	They
chafe	at	rules,	resent	others’	demands,	and

bright	light,	and	in	darkness	as	if	it	were	dim	light.
You	can’t	discern	color	in	darkness,	only	shades	of

increases	by	2,	and	your	Constitution	score	increases
by	1.

Alignment.	Half-orcs	inherit	a	tendency	toward
chaos	from	their	orc	parents	and	are	not	strongly
inclined	toward	good.	Half-orcs	raised	among	orcs
and	willing	to	live	out	their	lives	among	them	are

than	humans,	and	they	range	from	5	to	well	over	6
feet	tall.	Your	size	is	Medium.

Darkvision.	Thanks	to	your	orc	blood,	you	have
superior	vision	in	dark	and	dim	conditions.	You	can

Alignment. Tieflings	might	not	have	an	innate
tendency	toward evil,	but	many	of	them	end	up
there.	Evil	or	not,	an	independent	nature	inclines
many	tieflings	toward	a	chaotic	alignment.
Size.	Tieflings	are	about	the	same	size	and	build	as
humans.	Your	size	is	Medium.

Rage
In	battle,	you	fight	with	primal	ferocity.	On	your	turn,
you	can	enter	a	rage	as	a	bonus	action.
While	raging,	you	gain	the	following	benefits	if	you
aren’t	wearing	heavy	armor:
• You	have	advantage	on	Strength	checks	and
Strength	saving	throws.
• When	you	make	a	melee	weapon	attack	using
Strength,	you	gain	a	bonus	to	the	damage	roll	that
increases	as	you	gain	levels	as	a	barbarian,	as
shown	in	the	Rage	Damage	column	of	the
Barbarian	table.
• You	have	resistance	to	bludgeoning,	piercing,	and
slashing	damage.
If	you	are	able	to	cast	spells,	you	can’t	cast	them	or
concentrate	on	them	while	raging.
Your	rage	lasts	for	1	minute.	It	ends	early	if	you
are	knocked	unconscious	or	if	your turn	ends	and
you	haven’t	attacked	a	hostile	creature	since	your
last	turn	or	taken	damage	since	then.	You	can	also
end	your	rage	on	your	turn	as	a	bonus	action.
Once	you	have	raged	the	number	of	times	shown
for	your	barbarian	level	in	the	Rages	column	of	the
Barbarian	table,	you	must	finish	a	long	rest	before
you	can	rage	again.
Unarmored Defense
While	you	are	not	wearing	any	armor,	your	Armor
Class	equals	10	+	your	Dexterity	modifier	+	your
Constitution	modifier.	You	can	use	a	shield	and	still
gain	this benefit.
Not	for	resale.	Permission	granted	to	print	or	photocopy	this	document	for	personal	use	only. System	Reference	Document	5.1 9
Reckless Attack
Starting	at	2nd	level,	you	can	throw	aside	all	concern
for	defense	to	attack	with	fierce	desperation.	When
you	make	your	first	attack	on	your	turn,	you	can
decide	to	attack	recklessly.	Doing	so	gives	you
advantage	on	melee	weapon	attack	rolls	using
Strength	during	this	turn,	but	attack	rolls	against
you	have	advantage	until	your	next	turn.
Danger Sense
At	2nd	level,	you	gain	an	uncanny	sense	of	when
things	nearby	aren’t	as	they	should	be,	giving	you	an
edge	when	you	dodge	away	from danger.
You	have	advantage	on	Dexterity	saving	throws
against	effects	that	you	can	see,	such	as	traps	and
spells.	To	gain	this	benefit,	you	can’t	be	blinded,
deafened,	or	incapacitated.
Primal Path
At	3rd	level,	you	choose	a	path	that	shapes	the
nature	of	your	rage.	Choose	the	Path	of	the
Berserker	or	the	Path	of	the	Totem	Warrior,	both
detailed	at	the	end	of	the	class	description.	Your
choice	grants	you	features	at	3rd	level	and	again	at
6th,	10th,	and	14th	levels.
Ability Score Improvement
When	you	reach	4th	level,	and	again	at	8th,	12th,
16th,	and	19th	level,	you	can	increase	one	ability
score	of	your	choice	by	2,	or	you	can	increase	two
ability	scores	of	your	choice	by	1.	As	normal,	you
can’t	increase	an	ability	score	above	20	using	this
feature.
Extra Attack
Beginning	at	5th	level,	you	can	attack	twice,	instead
of	once,	whenever	you	take	the	Attack	action	on	your
turn.
Fast Movement
Starting	at	5th	level,	your	speed	increases	by	10	feet
while	you	aren’t	wearing	heavy	armor.
Feral Instinct
By	7th	level, your	instincts	are	so	honed	that	you
have	advantage	on	initiative	rolls.
Additionally,	if	you	are	surprised	at	the	beginning
of	combat	and	aren’t	incapacitated,	you	can	act
normally	on	your	first	turn,	but	only	if	you	enter
your	rage	before	doing	anything	else	on	that	turn.
Brutal Critical
Beginning	at	9th	level,	you	can	roll	one	additional
weapon	damage	die	when	determining	the	extra
damage	for	a	critical	hit	with	a	melee	attack.
This	increases	to	two	additional	dice	at	13th	level
and	three	additional	dice	at	17th	level.
Relentless Rage
Starting	at	11th	level,	your	rage	can	keep	you
fighting	despite	grievous	wounds.	If	you	drop	to	0	hit
points	while	you’re	raging	and	don’t	die	outright,
you	can	make	a	DC	10	Constitution	saving	throw.	If
you	succeed,	you	drop	to	1	hit	point	instead.
Each	time	you	use	this	feature	after	the	first,	the
DC	increases	by	5.	When	you	finish	a	short	or	long
rest,	the	DC	resets	to	10.
Persistent Rage
Beginning	at	15th	level,	your	rage	is	so	fierce	that	it
ends	early	only	if	you	fall	unconscious	or	if	you
choose	to	end	it.
Indomitable Might
Beginning	at	18th	level,	if	your	total	for	a	Strength
check	is	less	than	your	Strength	score,	you	can	use
that	score	in	place	of	the	total.
Primal Champion
At	20th	level,	you	embody	the	power	of the	wilds.
Your	Strength	and	Constitution	scores	increase	by	4.
Your	maximum	for	those	scores	is	now	24.
Path of the Berserker
For	some	barbarians,	rage	is	a	means	to	an	end—
that	end	being	violence.	The	Path	of	the	Berserker	is
a	path	of	untrammeled	fury, slick	with	blood.	As	you
enter	the	berserker’s	rage,	you	thrill	in	the	chaos	of
battle,	heedless	of	your	own	health	or	well-being.
Frenzy
Starting	when	you	choose	this	path	at	3rd	level,	you
can	go	into	a	frenzy	when	you	rage.	If	you	do	so,	for
the	duration	of	your	rage	you	can	make	a	single
melee	weapon	attack	as	a	bonus	action	on	each	of
your	turns	after	this	one.	When	your	rage	ends,	you
suffer	one	level	of	exhaustion	(as	described	in
appendix	PH-A).
